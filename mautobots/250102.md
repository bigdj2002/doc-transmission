### README for `graph-bot`

`graph-bot` is an AWS Lambda application designed to generate visual graphs (PNG format) for video quality metrics including **VMAF**, **SSIM**, and **PSNR**, using the `frqm` library. These graphs are generated based on statistics logs stored in Amazon S3 and are re-uploaded to the same S3 location after processing.

---

### Features

1. **Input Processing**  
   The application reads statistics logs from an S3 location provided as an argument.
   
2. **Graph Configuration**  
   Based on the specified metric and its corresponding threshold values, the application configures the graph settings.

3. **Graph Generation and Upload**  
   Using `matplotlib`, the graphs are generated and saved in PNG format. The output is then uploaded to the same S3 location.

### Build and Deployment

To deploy `graph-bot`, follow the steps below:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Ensure you are in the `graph-bot` project directory.

2. **Run the Deployment Script**  
   Use the provided script, `script/deploy.sh`, to deploy the infrastructure, including the AWS CodePipeline, service infrastructure, and Lambda code.

   **Command Syntax:**
   ```bash
   script/deploy.sh <codepipeline|service|lambda_code> <dev|prod>
   ```

---

### Deployment Options

The deployment script supports the following options:

1. **`codepipeline`**  
   Deploys or updates the AWS CodePipeline for managing CI/CD workflows. This pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment stages for the `graph-bot` application.

2. **`service`**  
   Deploys or updates the core infrastructure required for the `graph-bot` service, including S3 buckets, IAM roles, and other necessary AWS resources.

3. **`lambda_code`**  
   Deploys or updates the Lambda function code. Use this option to apply changes made to the `graph-bot` application without modifying the infrastructure.

---

### Environment Options

1. **`dev`**  
   Deploys the application in the development environment for testing purposes.

2. **`prod`**  
   Deploys the application in the production environment for real-world usage.

---

### Example Deployment Commands

1. **Deploy CodePipeline to Development:**
   ```bash
   script/deploy.sh codepipeline dev
   ```

2. **Deploy Service Infrastructure to Production:**
   ```bash
   script/deploy.sh service prod
   ```

3. **Deploy Updated Lambda Code to Production:**
   ```bash
   script/deploy.sh lambda_code prod
   ```
